# IndividualDisplacements.jl

**IndividualDisplacements.jl** computes individual displacments of elementary points over a gridded model domain. It can also read / write them from / to file. A typical application is the simulation and analysis of materials drifting or moving over the Global Ocean (e.g. plastics or planktons) or Atmosphere (e.g. dust or chemicals). Inter-operability with popular climate model grids and [MeshArrays.jl](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl) is an important prospect. `IndividualDisplacements.jl ` was initially designed in relation to [MITgcm](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest), [ECCOv4](https://eccov4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ([Forget et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3071-2015)), and [CBIOMES](https://cbiomes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model simulations.
